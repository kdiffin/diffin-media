Sick stack youâ€™ve got, Davud â€” this is clean, modern, and scalable af. Since you're going frontend-first with Templ + HTMX + Daisy UI, the key is to map out your **core user flow pages first**, starting with the MVP features you listed.

Hereâ€™s a prioritized breakdown of **frontend pages and components you should build first**, in the right order to not waste effort:

---

## ðŸ”¥ Phase 1 â€” MVP Pages (Core UX)

### 1. **Landing / Login Page**

- Route: `/` â†’ If not logged in, show login/signup
- Auth UI: Google/GitHub buttons (placeholder actions for now)
- If logged in, redirect to `/home`

> ðŸ’¡ Just mock the login button â€” wire the real OAuth later

---

### 2. **Home / Feed Page**

- Route: `/home`
- Show:

  - Tweet composer (form w/ text + image upload)
  - List of tweets (your reusable tweet card component)
  - Basic "like" button toggle

- HTMX: Clicking "like" or submitting a tweet should HTMX `POST`/`PUT` and swap just the tweet card

---

### 3. **Profile Page**

- Route: `/@username`
- Show:

  - Avatar, banner, bio, follow button
  - List of tweets by that user
  - Followers/following count

---

### 4. **Tweet Detail Page (Thread)**

- Route: `/tweet/:id`
- Show:

  - Full tweet
  - Replies (threaded comments)
  - Reply form (HTMX POST + swap)

---

### 5. **Global Chat Page**

- Route: `/chat`
- Use Alpine.js + WebSockets
- Minimal UI: list of messages, input box, live updates

> Can be a separate full-screen page or a sidebar on `/home`

---

### 6. **Search Page**

- Route: `/search?q=query`
- Show:

  - Tabs: Tweets, Users, Hashtags
  - Each list is HTMX-powered, paginated

## ðŸ§© Components To Build Early

These should go in `templ/components/` or whatever your Templ structure is:

| Component         | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `TweetCard`       | Tweet content + likes + avatar + timestamp      |
| `TweetComposer`   | Form for tweeting (text + optional image)       |
| `ProfileHeader`   | Banner, avatar, bio, follow button              |
| `ReplyCard`       | Just like TweetCard but nested                  |
| `ChatMessage`     | For the global chat feed                        |
| `Navbar`          | Logged-in nav bar (Home, Profile, Search, Chat) |
| `Modal` / `Toast` | Alpine-powered UI helpers (optional)            |

---

## ðŸŒ± Suggested Order to Build

1. **Login Page**
2. **TweetCard component**
3. **Home Page**
4. **TweetComposer**
5. **Profile Page**
6. **Tweet Detail Page + Replies**
7. **Navbar**
8. **Global Chat Page**
9. **Search Page**

---

## ðŸ”® Bonus Touches You Can Add Later

- Infinite scroll (HTMX or Alpine)
- Modal tweet composer (a la Twitter)
- Live notifications badge (Alpine + Redis pub/sub)
- User settings page (bio/avatar/banner edit)

---

If you want, I can generate a full **Templ file structure**, with some stub pages and components already laid out using your stack (HTMX partials, Daisy UI classes, `main.templ`, etc.). Just say the word.

Letâ€™s get that frontend flow looking fire before we hook up the Go backend ðŸ”ŒðŸ”¥
